# Qualitative-Spatial-Representation
My final year project with the topic "Qualitative Spatial Representation Using RCC8".

The representation of real world data in digital form is of huge interest in AI field. There has 
been many ways of representing the spatial information that exists in reality, and qualitative 
spatial representation is one of them. Furthermore, as the visual representations of spatial 
data are developed, there has been suggestion on extending the form of regions taken in the 
visualisation. Therefore, this project intends to implement software for modelling and 
visualising the qualitative representation of spatial data, using rectangular regions. It will use 
constraint approach to modelling the spatial information.
