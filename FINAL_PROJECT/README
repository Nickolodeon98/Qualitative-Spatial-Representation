The pynput should be installed using the following command:

pip install pynput

To use the program, simply run the python program main.py:

python client.py

Then the command line interface is shown as the following:

WELCOME! This is a spatial representation program.
**************************************************
Enter 1 to start using the program
Enter 2 to load the previous representation
Enter 3 to terminate the program
**************************************************
>>>

After entering 1 to start the program, follow the instructions to give inputs.
The maximum coordinates as well as the maximum widths and heights are 19 and the minimum is 1 for coordinates, 2 for width and height.

-----------------------------Phase 1--------------------------------
After giving every input, there are 8 relations you can visualise.

1. dc
- RCC-8 relation 'disconnected'
- Simply type 'dc' on command line interface (only in lower case)

2. ec
- RCC-8 relation 'externally connected'
- Simply type 'ec' on command line interface (only in lower case)

3. po
- RCC-8 relation 'partially overlaps'
- Simply type 'po' on command line interface (only in lower case)

4. tpp
- RCC-8 relation 'tangential proper part'
- Simply type 'tpp' on command line interface (only in lower case)

5. itpp
- RCC-8 relation 'inverted tangential proper part'
- Simply type 'itpp' on command line interface (only in lower case)

6. ntpp
- RCC-8 relation 'non-tangential proper part'
- Simply type 'ntpp' on command line interface (only in lower case)

7. intpp
- RCC-8 relation 'inverted non-tangential proper part'
- Simply type 'intpp' on command line interface (only in lower case)

8. eq
- RCC-8 relation 'equal'
- Simply type 'eq' on command line interface (only in lower case)

-----------------------------Phase 2--------------------------------
After entering one of the commands, the following menu appears:

***************************************************
Enter 1 to visualise this relation  
Enter 2 to try a different relation
Enter 3 to add one more region in this relation
Enter 4 to go back to the previous menu
Enter 5 to terminate the program
***************************************************
>>>

Follow the instructions that show up after entering one of the options.

Option 1: While the plot is appearing, in order to prompt another menu and go back to the beginning of phase 2, press space bar.
Option 2: The program goes back to phase 1
Option 3: The following shows up:

The region has been successfully added!
Where do you want to add a new region to?
**********************************
1. A
2. B
**********************************
>>>

Choose any region you want to add a new region to. Then the following appears:

***************************************************
What relation would you like a new region to have?
***************************************************
>>>

Type the name of relation (one of 8 commands introduced in phase 1),
then you are redirected to the beginning of the phase 2.

Option 4: The program goes back to phase 1. Same as option 2.
Option 5: The program terminates.
